1	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got , after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge . i was blown away
0	this light worked for one day . i should have known better because in the past , i bought a tap light , and it worked for only a few days , too . do n't waste your money
1	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , with the center snap closure , is the easiest to use . it is also the lightest and most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric . even when i try to sew it back into place , it breaks loose after a few washes . perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine , it would last longer . this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly the leading lady bra , which seems to be indestructible ) , but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort , lightness , and ease of use . it is by far my favorite
0	i have had my bag for a couple of months . the liner on the inside has already ripped
0	the photo is quite deceiving . this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap , shiny , and is horrible to the touch . my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness . spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit
1	i had bought a bra of this model at a discount store , just got lucky . it quickly became my favorite , and i was glad to find it at amazon .
0	lookslike it would be a nice product , but it 's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches . my baby is very long and just does n't fit - wish target/amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing
0	i purchased the non-premium kit ( $ 9.99 ) with a silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors ( one for each screen ) , but it is the same case . the problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery , twice as slippery as the nintendo lite without the cover . we thought that washing them in dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness , but that did n't work . after handling the cover , your hands have a slippery residue on them . the other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection , not impact protection . the screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok , i guess , but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised ( trust me , the screen was clean ) . i purchased 2 kits , and i had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort . i do not recommend this product at all
1	good quality jeans at an affordable price . size is just right , quite comfortable
0	not the best fabric , scratchy and see thru . you get what you pay for on these
